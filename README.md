# OSeq

[![build status](https://github.com/c-cube/oseq/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-cube/oseq/actions/)

Simple list of suspensions, as a composable lazy iterator that behaves like a value.

The type of sequences, `'a OSeq.t`, is compatible with the new standard type
of iterators `'a Seq.t`.
